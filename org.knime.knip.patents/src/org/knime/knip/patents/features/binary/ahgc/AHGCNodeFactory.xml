	<shortDescription>Calculates the AHGC Feature.</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Hierarchically computes the centroid of a region and divides it
			into four new subregions. For each of these subregions the centroid
			gets calculated again. The resulting feature vector consists of the x
			and y values of the centroids.
		</intro>
		<option name="Num Levels">
			Defines how many centroids should be calculated.
			Careful as the number of centroids rises exponentially.
		</option>
		<option name="White as background?">
			If white should be used as the background color.
		</option>

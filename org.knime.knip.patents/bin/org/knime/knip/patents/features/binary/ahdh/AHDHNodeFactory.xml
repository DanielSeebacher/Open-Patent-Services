	<shortDescription>Calculates the ADHD feature.</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Hierarchically computes the centroid of a region and divides it
			into four new subregions. For these four subregions the ratio of
			pixels in the subregion vs pixels in the whole region is calculated.
			These four ratios are then added to the feature vector.
		</intro>
		<option name="Num Levels">
			Defines how many centroids should be calculated.
			Careful as the number of centroids rises exponentially.
		</option>
		<option name="Relative Density Level">
			Beginning with which level the relative densitiy
			should be calculated.
		</option>
		<option name="White as background?">
			If white should be used as the background color.
		</option>
